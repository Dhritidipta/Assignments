The programmer who wrote this Doctor code was fired from the company, for failing to adhere to the naming conventions.

As you'll see later in the course, they should probably have been fired for other reasons as well (smile).


You've just joined the company, and have been given the job of making this code conform to the C# naming convention.

There are 8 deviations from the convention and Microsoft's recommendations - at least, 8 that we're aware of.


Bear in mind that 8 deviations result in more than 8 places where the code has to be changed.  If a variable is used in 3 places, then that single deviation will result in 3 changes to the code, for example.

It's also possible to have more than one deviation on the same line.


The challenge is to fix the code, so that it does conform to the convention.
